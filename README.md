# Password checker
This script checks the reliability of your password. I used pwnedpasswords API which has hundreds of millions of real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)
- Or just run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Usage
1. Save the script to a file (e.g. `password_checker.py`).
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
3. Run the script using the following command: `python password_checker.py <your_password>`

Example:
`python password_checker.py qwerty`
